    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p>
        Find SEPTA tries to answer one of life's big questions: <i>"Where the hell is my bus?"</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;While we love SEPTA and admire their dedication to providing Philly with fast, affordable mass transit, we're tired of guessing when the next trolley will come based on unreliable schedules, poorly-designed apps, or the location of the stars. SEPTA Tracker aims to show you the location of your bus or trolley in your browser - as simply and as quickly as possible.
    </p>
    
    <h1>How do you know where my bus is?</h1>
    <p>
        We use 'real-time' vehicle and route data published by SEPTA and updated every few minutes. Keep in mind, SEPTA's data isn't perfect! Sometimes vehicles appear and disappear magically, or show up in the wrong place on the map. Some of these errors are inevitable (trolleys can't transmit their location while they're in the tunnel, for example); some of them come from mistakes on SEPTA's end; some of them are, without a doubt, our fault. Whatever the case, if something looks wrong, feel free to tweet your issue to <a href="https://twitter.com/jean_cochrane">@jean_cochrane</a> or email <a href="mailto:jean@findsepta.org">Jean</a> or <a href="mailto:kalil@findsepta.org">Kalil</a> and we'll try our best to fix it.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Do you have an app for [Android/iPhone/Windows]?</h1>
    <p>
        If you like SEPTA Tracker but wish you could use it as a mobile app, you're in luck! You can easily bookmark this tracker on your mobile browser or save it to your home screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you really want a native app, there are many great options available to you. SEPTA, for one, publishes an app for iPhone and Android that offers realtime transit info and works pretty well. We've also heard good things about Transit Tracker Philly.
    </p>
    <p>
        But there's a reason that we decided to make SEPTA Tracker a website: <i>mobile apps are annoying.</i> They're OS-specific, they take up a lot of space on your device, and they can be a pain to develop and distribute. We want this information to be available to the public in a format that is <b>simple, quick, and universal</b>. 
    </p>
    
    <h1>Who's responsible for this?</h1>
