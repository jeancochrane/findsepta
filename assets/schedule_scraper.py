# schedule_scraper.py is a script for downloading, parsing, and converting
# SEPTA schedule data from HTML tables to JSON.

# Creates a folder in the current working directory called 'schedules' that
# contains every schedule indexed by route, day of the week, and destination.

# Required modules:
# 	x. requests (https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
