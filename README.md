# septa_tracker
A web app for geolocating SEPTA buses and trolleys in Philadelphia.

For development: make sure you have node/npm installed then run `npm install` in the directory. To watch files for changes, use `grunt watch`. To automatically reload changes in the browser (when you open the local file), install the [livereload extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei), open the file in your browser, and click the extension icon while the `grunt watch` task is running. 

To build for distribution, use `grunt dist`. Clean up with `grunt clean`.
